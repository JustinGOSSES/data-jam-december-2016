# data-jam-december-2016

This repo was part of a 3 hour data jam. After playing around with a leaflet.js map, I decided the quickest way forward would be to throw the data into Tableau Public. The <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/justin.gosses#!/vizhome/HoustonNorthsideNeighborhoodCrimeExploration2016_versionB/NorthsideHoustonCrime">visualizations</a> which resulted are plentiful but not always useful. Tableau is a great way to get data into data visualization format very quickly, which has value as a first-look, even if first look is messy.
